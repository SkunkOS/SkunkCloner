# SkunkCloner
Easily clone your FreeBSD system.<br>
Just run it and follow the dialogs.<br>
Features still lacking:<br>
- Does not clone the swap configuration. This is okay for desktop usage, as due to the swappiness, using swap is only detrimental to performance.<br>
- Pool size cannot yet be set (just uses whole disk space)<br>
- Separate boot and data pool cannot yet be cloned in one pass<br>
First public alpha, good enough for me to clone configured desktop systems to other computers, saving redundant installation work.<br>
Documentation will follow later, but the dialogs should be self-explaining.<br>
